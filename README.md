# Image Board Project

The Image Board project was assigned during a 3-month bootcamp at SPICED Academy.

## Overview

This is a Single Page Application where anybody could go and post an image of their choosing, along with a title and a textual description of that image, and others could go and look at that image and make thoughtful remarks about it.

I created a MUSIC IMAGE BOARD where I uploaded album cover of some of my favorit artists.
